  <h1>You Gotta Pay Your Dues Before You Pay The Rent</h1>
  <h3>Or: How Jack Black Ruined My Teaching Career</h2>
  <h4>April 5, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>I have been a musician for most of my life. In the early 2000's I had a little side business giving guitar lessons. There was a steady roster of 4 or 5 kids, mostly middle and high-school age. I'd teach from 8 am to noon on Saturdays. It was fun.
    </p>
    <p>
This changed in 2003 when the film School of Rock came out. For those who never saw it and for those who don't remember - Jack Black plays a slacker rock and roller dude who fills in as a substitute teacher for his roommate or something (honestly, I am not going to go to the minor trouble of Googling the details). Anyway, Jack Black has no teaching ability or credentials but he does know how to rock and/or roll. So he teaches valuable life lessons via music. Or something. I don't care.
    </p>
    <p>
The point is, the music shop I worked at was inundated with new students. My teaching load jumped to around 15 students. The extra money was great, but the actual worked became dissatisfying. The kids had watched that movie and come in expecting to be able to shred right away. When they discovered how much work it took to learn to play, they were disheartened and quit soon after. I am not blaming the kids and this isn't a generational "get off my lawn" kinda thing. It's just that the kids watched that movie and listened to the music and when their playing didn't compare favorably, they got disheartened. They said to themselves (and often to me) "I'm no good."

    </p>
    <p>In short, they had a fixed mindset - that playing guitar was something you were good at, or not good at. Those were the only two states; good or not good. They saw their musical ability as an attribute, not a skill. To me, an attribute is something that you are more-or-less born with, and is more-or-less immutable. I’m 5’11” and will likely continue to be 5’ 11”. No amount of practice is going to make me 6’5”. I don’t really blame the kids for feeling like musical ability is an attribute, that stupid movie certainly made it look like the kids just had innate musical ability. Also it’s been a while since I’ve been in school but my opinion is most education is dedicated to pushing people into boxes and keeping them there. Smart, dumb, gifted, slow, whatever. These labels function like attributes to young minds.

 </p>
<p>
Anyway, my feelings on education will be covered at some other point. Back to the topic.

My guitar students would have benefited from looking at playing music as a skill. Skills can be developed through practice. When considering a skill it is important to look at how far you’ve come, not how far you have to go. I wish I had known more about these two mindsets back then. I think I could have reframed my teaching, and reframed how I encouraged my kids. It’s possible that more of them would still be playing today.

But mostly, I just blame Jack Black.
