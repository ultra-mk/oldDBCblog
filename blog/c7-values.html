  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h3></h3>
  <h4>May 3, 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>This is about the fourth version of this blog post that I have pushed to github. It is safe to say that I am not comfortable with this topic at all. The word 'values' bothers me a great deal. To me, it indicates an unwavering belief that is deeply held. I think what bothers me is that I do not have those types of beliefs. Perhaps it's a function of being older. Perhaps it's my natural cynicism. Perhaps it's specific to some of my experiences. </p>

<p> But I don't have those kinds of beliefs. And this exercise made me extremely uncomfortable. It made me feel defensive and deficient. Like I am the only one who feels this way. I read a few of my cohort-mates posts on this topic. (and there is NO WAY I am posting this to twitter. Sorry gang, this stays up for about four days and that's it.) </p>

<p>Anyway, while reading the posts, I saw things like valuing hard work, family, achievement and none of those things really matter to me. Hard work when it's a labor of passion is a wonderful thing. But it's not a value that should be applied no matter what. Some things are not worth hard work. I've worked for bosses that I've loved and I would run through walls for. Other places and people, not so much. Recognizing the difference is important to me. Family is the same way - I have family members that I love and family members that I don't. The fact that we share DNA means nothing to me. Achievement is another thing that I really don't understand. Achievement to me is always something that is proscribed by another. Being a doctor or a lawyer is an achievement. Graduating top of your class is an achievement. There's a social definition to achievement. Again, maybe it's because I'm older, but I've spent a lot of time trying to make people proud of me. It doesn't work. Make yourself proud. Anything else is a lie.</p>

<p>So I think this will be my last pass at this. I thought it was hurtful to hold up a list of things and suggest that everyone ought to feel something on the list. I don't. I don't see how any of this is helpful to learning a skill, and I learned nothing from the activity. Other cultural assignments have been really interesting and enlightening. This one, not so much. If you want to know how I plan to get through the rough days, I'll probably have a bit of whiskey, a bit of beer and play some video games. But I don't think that's the answer that's being sought. </p>
