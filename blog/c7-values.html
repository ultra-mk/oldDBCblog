  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h3>Don't. Just don't.</h3>
  <h4>May 3, 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>I’ve read this release all week long and I’m not sure what the objective is. Yeah, just read it again and I got nothing. And I just read it one more time. Alrighty, I am going to ignore the instructions and do what I think is being asked of me. I don’t understand the idea of values. I think it’s too limiting to think of things in those terms. I value this. I do not value that. I really don’t know what that means. A person ought to have a process. A process of absorbing new information or experiences. To me, applying a value to all situations is ridiculous. An example, say you value honesty. Honesty is important to you and a person ought to be honest in all situations. What if you work for a dishonest employer? Being honest in that situation will likely lead to sub-optimal outcome.</p>

<p>I guess if I had to boil it down, treat like for like. In the face of dishonesty, act dishonestly. Cheat cheaters. Treat the fair fairly. Anything else is silly or naive. Don’t have values. They limit you.</p>
