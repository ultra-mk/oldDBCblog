  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h3></h3>
  <h4>May 3, 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>I don't have values. There really isn't another way to put it. The things listed in release 1 - none of them resonate with me. Perhaps music does, because I am a musician, but that isn't a value. It's a skill. Perhaps a passion, but not a value. At my heart, I am a cynic. I am doubtful about humans and especially doubtful about human institutions. Ultimately everything can and will be corrupted. Believing that a belief will save you is especially foolhardy to my way of thinking. </p>

<p>The only thing I especially believe is you have to take people as they come and you have to take them one at a time. To me, that means listening to them. It means watching their actions. It means, returning like for like. You ought to treat those not as you would like to be treated, but how they treat you. I've worked for dishonest companies and rewarding dishonesty with honesty is foolish. I know it's foolish because that's exactly what I did. I believed 'doing the right thing' was in fact, the right thing. It's not. You will be taken advantage of. So that's my value system - like for like.This has been a particularily depressing blog topic. </p>
