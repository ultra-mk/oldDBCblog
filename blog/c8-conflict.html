  <h1>Conflicts</h1>
  <h3></h3>
  <h4>May 9, 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>Conflict is an existential component of all life. Given that conflict has existed for the entirety of human existence, I doubt I will be figuring out a way to eliminate it. Perhaps just share a few ideas and experiences of how I deal with it.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, I have worked as a sound designer and composer for a number of projects. Some short films, a web series and a whole lot of theater. Most, if not all of these projects have had conflict crop up at some time or another. Some of these conflicts have been resolved amicably and the project was better for it, other conflicts have ended personal and professional relationships. </p>
<p>The conflicts I have experienced in this area always revolve around communication. Translating a director's vision of music and sound into actual music and sound is not easy. If a director could just say "I want it to be 120 beats per minute, with strings playing a melody in D-minor with a trombone counterpoint and works in the relative major" - there really wouldn't be a need for a composer. It would be transcription, not composition. It's not a director's job to be an expert at music or sound. </p>
<p>The times that have ended badly all have one thing in common - I thought I knew what the director wanted. When I delivered the score, I found out that I was mistaken. And that feeling of turning something in, something that I was proud of, just to have it rejected causes a whole bunch of negative feelings. Feelings of inadequacy - feelings of anger. Basically stuff that will ensure that no positive communication can happen.</p>
<p>Over the years I've learned that it's not the director's job to express themselves clearly, it is MY job to get their ideas out of them. It's my role to facilitate communication that makes it easy for them to explain what they want.</p>
<p>I think there's a corollary in the software field. Getting the client to express what they want is difficult. They don't always know what they want. They don't know how to phrase it. They don't know how to communicate with developers.</p>
<p> So my thoughts on how to manage these conflicts. One, never think you understand what they want. Two, see rule number one and keep asking questions. Three, give them options. This was one of the biggest things I discovered. When developing a score for a client, I used to write a big, impressive piece of music to showcase my ideas. When those ideas didn't fit, it was easy to feel disrespected. The biggest improvement to that was a concept I call "Ten-One". Meaning, I work on an idea for ten minutes OR until I have one minute of music - whichever is less. This yields a lot of different ideas that I don't necessarily have a stake in. I've only spent ten minutes on them. This eliminates an emotional connection for me. I don't feel anything in particular about a given idea. The presence of options opens up a discussion. </p>
