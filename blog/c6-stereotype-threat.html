  <h1>Sterotype Threat</h1>
  <h3><!--subtitle--></h3>
  <h4>April 25, 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>
I am a bit of a loss at where to begin with this topic. Confession time; I had never heard the term "stereotype threat" before yesterday. That is an indictment of how privileged I am. Second confession; only in the last couple of years have I become aware of how privileged I am. Thinking about stereotype threat is difficult, and even a bit uncomfortable. I'm gonna try my best here to understand this issue and approach it with respect.</p>

<p>I really really don't feel comfortable summarizing the concept of stereotype threat, but here goes. Research has indicated that groups of people perform more poorly on a task if they think their behavior will conform with an existing negative stereotype. A few examples; female chess players have been shown to play worse when told they are playing against men rather than women. African Americans have been shown to perform worse on SAT's when told it's a test of intelligence.</p>

<p>
In the first example, the female chess player is aware of the stereotype that men are better chess players than women. Fearing that she will conform with that stereotype, her performance suffers. In the second example, an African-American test taker is aware of the stereotype that African-Americans are not as intelligent as other races, and that leads to reduced performance. </p>

<p> While I hadn't heard of stereotype threat before, I have no problem understanding and believing these findings. People internalize messages about themselves and groups they belong to. I'm reminded of the famous blue-eye/brown-eye experiment from the late 60's. When children were told that blue-eyed children did better in school, they did. </p>

<p>I have tried hard to think of a time when I've felt like this and I can't seem to do it. The closest I can get is my religious background. I was raised protestant and I rejected that teaching in my late teens. Many people at my church thought I had the skills to be a gifted preacher. I know it has disappointed my parents that I never became a minister.</p>

<p>The point being, the very few times that I am forced to interact with that church (pretty much weddings and funerals), I feel, if not outright condemnation, a sense that people are judging me. I feel the eyes on me and I know that they are thinking that I have deviated from my true calling and the true faith. There's an idea that my Buddhist beliefs are a false religion and I'm condemned to burn in hell for all time. I certainly do not take any of their concerns to heart, but nonetheless it's not a pleasant experience. The interesting thing here is those messages are specifically directed at me and my specific choices. Those choices don't reflect on other males, other white people, or even other Buddhists. And therein is the big difference from being judged and stereotype threat. Stereotype threat is not about who you are, but rather what group you belong to.</p>

<p>It's hard for me to imagine what that's like. The first word that comes to mind is "tiring". It must be tiring to always be judged in the context of a group. It must be tiring to know that people have an opinion about what kind of person you should be based on your gender or the color of your skin. I don't think this is a terribly good blog post, but looking into this has certainly given me a new perspective.</p>
