  <h1>Zigzagging Toward the Light</h1>
  <h3>Getting Lost in CSS Positioning</h2>
  <h4>March 28, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>This week's technical blog topic was a no-brainer. I have been, and continue to be, completely baffled by CSS positioning. As I write this, I look at the three types of positioning with a mix of confusion and helpless rage. The words don't make any sense to me - relative, absolute and fixed. In particular I have gotten tripped up in trying to understand how 'absolute' and 'fixed' are two different things. To me, if something (anything, not just CSS) has an 'absolute' position, then that position is also 'fixed'. It's synonymous to me.  Example, the Washington Monument's position is located at 38.8895° N, 77.0352° W. That position is fixed in space. Likewise, it is an absolute position. (As opposed to my position relative to the Washington Monument - it changes all the time)

    </p>
    <p>I've been researching this off and on for the past couple of days and the bafflement continues unabated. This is where I feel at my most stupid. I'm not really a visual person. I've never been able to draw, I don't understand that certain colors "go" together. Working on the "palette" for my site is a disorienting, terrifying prospect - like shopping at Ikea.

But the Google-mining has continued in earnest and I've finally found some things I can wrap my underdeveloped visual cortex around.

    <p>So I’m going to run through these and attempt to explain them as best as I can.</p>

<p>Fixed: This is the easiest for me to understand. The element is fixed in relation to the viewport of the browser. This type of positioning makes sense for navigation elements or sidebars. If you want an element to be in the same position, no matter how much you scroll, use fixed.
</p>

<p>Absolute: Similar to fixed, but the position is relative to the entire browser window, not just the viewport - meaning that scrolling will not affect it. You put the element in the position you want and it says there regardless of scrolling. Where I am a bit confused still is how this works when the element has a parent. It seems that absolute behaves differently when it has a parent element. Everything I’ve read indicates this is the trickiest value to get. I can’t say I’m there yet.
</p>

<p>
Relative: Again, I feel like I’m mucking this up a bit. According to froont.com “(Relative elements) serve as a local frame of reference for absolutely positioned child elements.” That kinda makes sense to me - it’s like a box (well, it IS a box) and within that box are elements. You arrange those elements within that box and they have an absolute position relative to the parent.
</p>

<p>Out of all the things we are learning at DBC, CSS is the one that scares me the most. I expect there will be more of these types of posts, where it’s less about me explaining something and more like a transcript of my fumbling around.

Let the fumbling continue!
