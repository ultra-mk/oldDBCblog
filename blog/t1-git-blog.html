  <h3>A Tale of Version Control Mishaps</h3>
  <h4>March 19, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I am starting my Dev Bootcamp journey this week.  The topics for this include version control, git and GitHub.

For eight years, my professional life was a nightmare of poor version control. I was a senior buyer at a Fortune 50 manufacturing company. (Well, at least it was Fortune 50 in those days.) Much of my time was spent bidding out parts contracts in a quest to find cost savings. On paper, it was a simple job. Send the blueprints and performance specs out to three suppliers, get a bid, negotiate a bit and have the cheapest supplier build the parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reality was different. The parts were built to the print and many times they didn't fit. Something had changed but the blueprint hadn't been updated. The version control system failed. It was impossible to know the extent of the changes or why they were made. The entire design record became unreliable. The accepted practice within our department became to have our suppliers tear down an existing part and essentially re-engineer it. The costs of re-engineering would often offset any cost savings of moving to a more competitive supplier.

        The benefits of version control are pretty clear to me. Without it, you have to tear everything down and rebuild from scratch.

        I've started learning about git this week. My brain is still wrapping around the terms, clone - fork - branch - fetch. I can manage to commit my changes and see them in GitHub, but the 'how' is still a mystery. In my Googling, I came across the following and a lot of light was shed for me.

My brain was stuck thinking of each repo as a bunch of files and every commit was just adding a new file or overwriting an existing one. Rather each commit is a commit object and it has a unique 40 character string to identify it. The key takeaway is each commit can be referred to by that string, and those strings can be found by using the git log. It seems slightly less impenetrable. Each commit is it's own object - it's own thing, and that thing has a name. And if I need that thing, I just use it's name to get it.

    </p>

The last thought I have is regarding GitHub. I'm really looking forward to exploring it more and maybe finding some cool open source projects to work on. I love Premier League soccer and a cursory search tells me there are 192 repos related to that topic. I'm looking forward to the day when I could maybe clone one of those and do something to move a project along. They will be small contributions at first, to be sure, but just getting something out there is so exciting to me.
