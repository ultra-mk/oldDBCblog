  <h1>Problems with the H1-B Visa</h1>
  <h3>An Extremely Short Introduction</h2>
  <h4>April 11, 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>Well, I am going to delve into some potentially dangerous waters this week - the problems with the H1-B visa. </p>

<p>Let me start with recitations of my beliefs:</p>

<ol>
<li>Immigration is categorically a good thing.</li>
<li>I am not a nativist or an isolationist.</li>
<li>Immigration is a hugely complicated issue and reasonable people can disagree</li>
<li>There are a great number of unreasonable people.</li>

</ol>

<p>The H1-B visa was created originally to allow workers with specialized skills to work in the United States. Those skills were typically tech, biotech, architecture and other "specialty occupations." The H1-B is not conceived to be a path to citizenship or even permanent status. The visa is tied to an employer sponsor - meaning the visa is only good while someone is working for a specific employer. If they quit or are dismissed, they have to apply for a different immigration status or find another sponsor. The program had a noble intent originally - bring in highly skilled people to work for specific time. Examples;  bringing a world-famous architect from Portugal to design a new skyscraper, hiring a British theater director to work on a Broadway show, or having a world-renowned biotech expert from New Zealand delivering a series of lectures.

</p>

<p>The program is not being used in the way it was intended and it's being used to create a modern version of indentured servitude. Because an employer must sponsor someone for an H1-B Visa, it creates a massive power imbalance between employer and employee. This imbalance leads to reduced employee mobility and depressed wages.

</p>

<p>I've had horrible jobs. And I've quit horrible jobs. As a citizen, I have the right to move to a new state or work for any employer in this country. Employee mobility is good. It matches up skills and temperaments to jobs that they are best suited for. I have been a supply chain professional for fifteen years. I am quite good at it, but I've never really liked it. Even now, when I work at a great company and have a great boss, the truly satisfying days are few and far between. I can, for example quit my job and learn a new skill and try to break into a new industry. People who are on an H1-B visa have no such mobility. If they want to stay in this country, they quite literally (and I literally mean literally) cannot quit there job without massive consequences. The employer becomes all-powerful. The threat of being fired means they can mandate whatever they want. If my current employer asks me to work 80 hours a week for the exact same pay, I can walk and find another job with more reasonable demands. An H1-B Visa does not have that freedom.


According to <a class='article'href="http://www.pri.org/stories/2013-03-07/h-1b-visas-leave-immigrant-workers-disadvantage-while-some-critics-fume"> PRI story from 2013</a>

</p>
<q>But unlike his American co-workers, every time (an H1-B) switches jobs, he loses his visa sponsorship and risks deportation.

“It’s like you have a sword on your neck,” he said. “You have to find a job."</q>

<p>This issue is massively complex and I find myself torn on a solution. I veer between removing the employer-sponsorship requirements to jettisoning the program all together. At the very least, removing the sponsorship requirement would alleviate the mobility issue and it would restore some autonomy to employees.</p>
