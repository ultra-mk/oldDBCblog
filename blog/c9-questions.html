  <h1>Playing at Questions</h1>
  <h3></h3>
  <h4>May 17, 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>This week's topic is questions and the asking of them. What makes a good question? A good question is one that yields a useful answer. To that end, I think the biggest key to a good question is specificity. Even if you think it's a specific question, it can probably be made more so. A big part of my former job was interviewing suppliers. </p>
<p>"Tell me about your business" is not exactly a question. It's open ended and has a high probability of drifting off topic or devolving into generalities. I can't count how many suppliers have talked about "customer service" as an abstract concept. "Having good customer service" doesn't actually mean anything at all. If I opened every meeting with that question, I'd waste 10-20 minutes each time.I think a better way to open this type of discussion would be "I have a number of well-qualified suppliers already, how does your business set itself apart?". The request for a specific answer will either drive the conversation to specifics or if the supplier answers only in generalities, it's likely they don't actually have specifics to offer. Which means it's no a supplier you need to be doing business with.</p>

<p>I think the same can be applied to technical questions. I think it's better to ask something like "What method would sum these elements within an array?" rather than "I wanna add this stuff all up, how do I do it?".</p>

<p>For me, I think a key to remember is to ask the question before I get frustrated. I think once frustration sets in, it's both hard to ask a good question, and difficult to really listen to the answer. So my rule will be if I start to get frustrated, take some time and break. I've found that even taking 3 minutes can clear my head a bit. If I come back after that and am still confused, ask a good, specific question.</p>
