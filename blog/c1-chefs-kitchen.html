  <h1>Body-Mind or Not Crossing Your Arms When Cross</h1>
  <h3>Considering the DBC approach</h2>
  <h4>March 19, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>I started considering attending a development bootcamp about two months ago. Living in Chicago grants me access to a number of bootcamps without having hassle of relocating.  The thing that stuck out the most about DBC was the approach to the whole person - making yoga mandatory was a big selling point. Maybe some people find it ‘touchy-feely’ - I’m not even sure what that means. What I do know is there is very little separating the body from the mind. A number of Zen Buddhists refer to a person as a body-mind. There is no difference.

    </p>
    <p>Anyone can work harder or work faster or do more, or stay up later than the other person. It’s my belief that there is a limit that will be reached and thinking you can surpass it by simply working harder is silly.  I had a colleague from Sweden who used to say “Some things are built, and can be built faster. Other things must grow."

    </p>
    <p>Not every task can be accomplished quicker. Some things take the time that they will take. You can't make a tomato plant grow faster by watering it more. DBC seems to realize this. The code can't really be separated from the coder and if one is unhealthy, both are unhealthy. Hence, the approach to do yoga, learn empathy, take breaks, go the gym, ect. Clearly there is a ridiculous amount of work waiting for me in the coming months, but devs are not simply built, they must be grown

    </p>
    <p>
    So yeah, I’m concerned I will fall into a cynical pessimism and retreat. But I’m aware that’s how I have approached the world up till now. Hopefully that self-awareness will kick in when I start to pull myself away. I am hoping I can give myself the opportunity to grow.
