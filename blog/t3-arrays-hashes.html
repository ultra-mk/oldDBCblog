  <h1>A Ray of Light</h1>
  <h3>Or: HULK HASH!</h2>
  <h4>April 3, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Data structures FTW! After last week's tentative foray into CSS, I'm back squarely in my comfort zone. It's so cuddly, and soft and warm. There's a mug of hot cocoa, Miles Davis on Spotify, and I'm wearing sweatpants. All the comforts. All the zone.

I am a confessed data junkie. My obsession with data is a large part of why I'm at DBC now. About a year ago, I took a job that was heavy on data analysis. It quickly became clear that just mucking about with Excel was not going to be sufficient. Some of the data sets didn't even fit within a workbook. Other sets were unstructured and required a great deal of munging to get it in shape. I had been dinking around with python here and there and I bought Wes McKinney's "Python for Data Analysis". Over a period of months, I completely replaced Excel with python-pandas as my analysis tool.

So, yeah - this is not intended to be a discussion about python-pandas, but that is merely prologue to this week's topic; data structures in Ruby - specifically Arrays and Hashes.

    </p>
    <p>Data has to be contained by something. On it's own it's practically worthless - let me give you an example

<pre>green, Iron Man, blue, The Hulk, Chevy Corvette, Arsenal, Walking, Manchester City.</pre>
<p>
What does that dataset mean? Without context, it's merely a string of letters. They must be contained within something that gives them meaning. An array is the simplest kind of container. It contains a list of stuff (ok, fine "objects"). Let's look at our dataset as arrays

    </p>
    <p>
    <pre>
  colors = ['green','blue']

  super_heroes = ['Iron Man', 'The Hulk']

  mode_of_transport = ['Chevy Corvette', 'Walking']

  soccer_teams = ['Arsenal', 'Manchester City']
    </pre>
    </p>
    <p>Isn't that better? The data starts to mean something. We have a list of stuff that all goes together.

But there is another aspect of arrays - an array is ordered, meaning the stuff is contained in a specific order. Let me give you an example; here are five soccer teams from the English Premier League: Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City. We can order this data in a variety of ways

 </p>
 <p>
 <pre>

  alphabetical = ['Arsenal', 'Chelsea','Liverpool', 'Manchester City','Manchester United']

  current_rank = ['Chelsea', 'Manchester City', 'Arsenal', 'Manchester United', 'Liverpool']

  old_to_new = ['Manchester United', 'Manchester City', 'Arsenal', 'Liverpool', 'Chelsea']

  </pre>
</p>
<p>
The order of the array is important - it conveys information about the data contained within it.

 </p>
 <p>
The other workhorse data structure in Ruby is the hash. A hash also contains data, but it contains it in pairs rather than single values (I know that arrays can be multi-dimensional, but for simplicity's sake....). I'm going to re-arrange our first dataset into two hashes. One for Iron Man, and one for The Hulk.
</p>
<p class='code'>
<pre>
iron_man = {'name' =>'Iron Man',
                   'eye_color' =>'blue',
                   'mode_of_transport' => 'Chevy Corvette',
                   'favorite_soccer_team'=> 'Manchester City'}
</pre>
</p>
<pre>
hulk = {'name' => 'The Hulk',
           'eye_color' => 'green',
           'mode_of_transport' => 'Walking',
           'favorite_soccer_team' => 'Arsenal'}
</pre>
<p>
The data is stored in a key-value pairs. We could look up the eye color for Hulk and it would come back green. In that case, 'eye_color' is the key and 'green' is the value. Whereas an array draws context from the entire array, a hash draws context from the key in the key-value pair. Both are important and both are necessary.
