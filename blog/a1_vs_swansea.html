        <h1>Vs. Swansea</h1>
        <h3>Swans flap their wings and Ospina flaps his arms</h3>

            I had a bit of a bad feeling going into yesterday's game. There was a sense that our good run couldn't go on forever and for whatever reason, Swansea seems to have our number this year. Also, with Chelsea having the title wrapped up, I just got this feeling that Swansea had more to play for. If you had told me yesterday morning the match would end 1-0 to the Swans, I wouldn't have been surprised.

            What surprised me was the goal. To be perfectly honest, I think that was the first match I've seen where goal line technology was used to give a goal. Been meaning to look that up. When referee Kevin Friend pointed at his watch in response to Ospina's protests, I honestly thought Friend was saying "Look mate, they scored. You got four minutes so you best shut up and get on with it." It wasn't until a bit later that I realized he was actually saying "Shit son, this watch went 'ding' which means the ball went in." In the Ospina-Szczesny discussion, I am firmly on the side of Team Ospina, but nonetheless I think he could have done a bit better with that ball. But it was such an Arsenal-y goal to give up that I can hardly attribute 100% fault to Ospina.

           <p>I've found myself thinking lately if Arsenal has in fact made progress this season. I think the answer is a qualified "yes". We're in a cup final. Champions League football is almost assured. St Tottering's Day has come for the 20th season in a row. The purchases in the transfer market have worked out quite well, and for the first time in a long time, there aren't any obvious holes in the lineup. Also promising is the fact we haven't had to sell anyone. Sanga left because he wanted to and Vermaelen was sold because there wasn't a place for him in the side.</p>

           <p>So yes, on all those fronts I think we can say we made progress. I still say 'qualified' because of what I saw in yesterday's match. It's not that we lost, it's that we lost in an extremely predictable way. Swansea sat deep and looked to frustrate us. We've seen this time and time again. For the moment, I am going to hope that it was case of Swansea being extra-prepared and us not exactly giving a shit. Otherwise, there's a concern that Arsenal's tactics can (once again) be countered quite easily.</p>
