  <h1>Let's Take A Trip Together</h1>
  <h3>Don't Fear Pair Programming</h2>
  <h4>April 18, 2015</h4>

  <section>

<p>Out of everything in the Phase-0 curriculum, I feared pair programming the most. It seemed like a super awkward way to learn. Two noobs,  fumbling around with code and breaking shit. It sounded horrible. I started scheming to avoid it almost immediately upon acceptance to Dev Bootcamp.</p>

<p>But I was wrong. So far every pair session has been super positive. Every partner I've paired with has brought enthusiasm and a really good attitude. I'm not the most enthusiastic person in the world, and my base attitude is pretty cynical, but in every session I've worked in the enthusiasm of my partners has been infectious. I now try to bring that to every session - the idea of "let's get in here and mess up some stuff together!" rather than "this is an assignment to be gotten through and that's it." Every pairing has made me think about a problem in a different way. Quite frankly, every session has made me better. </p>

<p>Pairing has been most helpful in teaching me that there’s more than one way to the solution. More than one way to skin a cat (why is that even a saying?). I’m not sure what it is about my brain, but thus far I’ve fixated on finding THE solution to a problem. Pairing has taught me that the real task is finding A solution to the problem. Being able to look at things through someone else’s eyes is really unique.</p>

<p>One bit of feedback that I’ve gotten has stuck with me. A pair said (in essence) that I’m good at research and combing the documents, but sometimes I spend too much time looking for a perfect method rather than using one I already know. I’ve noticed this in my own work, I spend a lot of time trying to make it elegant rather than getting it to work. I don’t know if it’s the musician part of me, but I want the code to be elegant, and perfect with no extraneous steps.</p>

<p> But I really have to face up to the fact that I am a beginner. I have to be comfortable with it not being perfect.</p>
