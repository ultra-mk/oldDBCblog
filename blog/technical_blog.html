            <p>As I've mentioned several times. I love data and databases. SQL was the first language (so to speak) that I had any interest in. The relational database has always been a source of joy to me. Yes, joy. Something about it just tickles my brain. A well-designed schema just looks...perfect to me. (Did I mention the data nerd bit?)</p>

            <h3>Wherin I phone it in yet again</h3>
            <h4>May 3, 2015</h4>

            <p>Warning; editorializing follows. Even before I started Dev Bootcamp, I was somewhat aware that JavaScript had a rough reputation. This curriculum this week has reinforced that idea. There were a few snide remarks in the challenges (e.g. "Do you miss Ruby yet?") and the Google+ community page has it's share of people complaining. </p>

    <h3></h3>
    <h4>April 26, 2015</h4>

        <p>
            After a couple weeks of phoning it in, I'm re-dedicating myself to blogging. Working hard to get excited and stay excited. Fortunately, this week's topic is making that easy. It's a brief discussion of the differences between functional and object-oriented programming. I can only claim the dimmest of dim understanding of object oriented programming and my knowledge of functional programing is even dimmer. But we shall sally forth bravely. </p>

            <h3>A person and a spaceship are actually quite different</h3>

            <p>
                This week has been spent crushing through Ruby classes and the beginnings of object-oriented programming. Classes are similar things that do similar stuff. They have attributes that are similar and they take similar actions. For example, a human being has more in common with a cheetah than it does, say, a radish. Human beings and cheetahs both move around on things called legs. Radishes are known to be rather stationary. However, one might take a further step back and say that human, cheetahs and radishes are all living things, and have more in common with each other than they do with say...a drill press. Where to draw lines and how to create classes seems to me to be one of the most fundamental skills in Ruby. </p>

                The map and the each method are closely related. On first glance they look almost identical.

            <p>Data structures FTW! After last week's tentative foray into CSS, I'm back squarely in my comfort zone. It's so cuddly, and soft and warm. There's a mug of hot cocoa, Miles Davis on Spotify, and I'm wearing sweatpants. All the comforts. All the zone.</p>

            <h3>Getting Lost in CSS Positioning</h2>
  <h4>March 28, 2015</h4>

    <p>This week's technical blog topic was a no-brainer. I have been, and continue to be, completely baffled by CSS positioning. As I write this, I look at the three types of positioning with a mix of confusion and helpless rage. </p>

            <p>
                I am starting my Dev Bootcamp journey this week. The topics for this include version control, git and GitHub. For eight years, my professional life was a nightmare of poor version control.</p>
