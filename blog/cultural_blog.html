            <h1>Playing at Questions</h1>
            <h3></h3>
            <h4>May 17, 2015</h4>
            <p>This week's topic is questions and the asking of them. What makes a good question? A good question is one that yields a useful answer. To that end, I think the biggest key to a good question is specificity. Even if you think it's a specific question, it can probably be made more so. A big part of my former job was interviewing suppliers. </p>

            <h3></h3>

            <section>
                <p>Conflict is an existential component of all life. Given that conflict has existed for the entirety of human existence, I doubt I will be figuring out a way to eliminate it. Perhaps just share a few ideas and experiences of how I deal with it.</p>

                I am a bit of a loss at where to begin with this topic. Confession time; I had never heard the term "stereotype threat" before yesterday.</p>

            <h3>Don't Fear Pair Programming</h2>
  <h4>April 18, 2015</h4>


<p>Out of everything in the Phase-0 curriculum, I feared pair programming the most. It seemed like a super awkward way to learn. Two noobs,  fumbling around with code and breaking shit. It sounded horrible. I started scheming to avoid it almost immediately upon acceptance to Dev Bootcamp.</p>

  <h3>Or: How Jack Black Ruined My Teaching Career</h2>
  <h4>April 5, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>I have been a musician for most of my life. In the early 2000's I had a little side business giving guitar lessons. There was a steady roster of 4 or 5 kids, mostly middle and high-school age. I'd teach from 8 am to noon on Saturdays. It was fun.

  <h3>Considering the DBC approach</h2>
  <h4>March 19, 2015</h4>

    <p>I started considering attending a development bootcamp about two months ago. Living in Chicago grants me access to a number of bootcamps without having hassle of relocating.</p>
